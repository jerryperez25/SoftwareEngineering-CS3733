	The game will be launched through the Launcher class which displays the Double-Slided game board!
	
	When the user attempts to play the game, clicks that are not valid will simply not be accounted for. Every move will
	increment the move counter by one up until a reset is requested, which will bring the counter back down to 0. When the player 
	clicks a tile that leads to a winning board, they will be prompted on the Console that they have won the game. 
	In an attempt to freeze JUST the JPanel upon winning, the "get" method in DSApp did not cooperate so I just left it as is. 
	I understand I could have frozen the entire App, but that would eliminate functionality of hitting the reset button 
	after either a winning or a losing move. Upon losing the game, the player will be prompted on the console as well that
	they have lost the game, and they will be prompted to reset. The JPanel statement applies here as well. To close the 
	application, the user may click the red button (for mac) or red "X" (on pc), followed by striking "yes".
	
	I hope you enjoy,
